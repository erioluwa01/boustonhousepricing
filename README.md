## 🎯 Purpose & Real-World Impact

In the real estate industry, property valuation is often influenced by subjective judgment or delayed by manual assessments. This project addresses that challenge by:

- Providing **instant price predictions** for homes based on objective data.
- Helping **buyers** make more informed decisions.
- Enabling **sellers** and **agents** to estimate market value more accurately.
- Reducing dependency on traditional appraisal methods.
- Offering a **scalable, cloud-based solution** that can be extended to different cities or data sources.

By automating the pricing process with machine learning, this solution improves **efficiency, transparency, and accessibility** in real estate transactions.
